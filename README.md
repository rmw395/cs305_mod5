## hunger games sim
* you know the hunger games simulator that everyone plays 2 times before getting bored and forgetting about it?
* i want to make that.
  * i want to make it better.
  * do i know how to make it better? no. but i will try.
* one of these days i will actually make my own hunger games sim.
  * but for now, it is a fake project for class.
## license
**MIT license**
* the MIT license works for this project because i don't care what people do with it.
* this license allows people to use my project however they want, for pretty much any purpose.
* i'm fine with people doing random stuff with this little project. so MIT license is good.

## crazy events 

* have you ever wanted to see one of your character fly into the air and die? I sure have! with this, i am adding new events that can change up the games. 
* events including getting rocketed into the air, a tornado swooping a character away, or a tsunami with crush soda
